Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
i overloaded methods showOptions() and gotofloor() because their implementaion differs depending on the type of the building 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

initally i was stuck with the way of overloading the gotofloor() because I didn't get the logical differnece between or how should i show this logic within the code
